CHAPTER 6: METHODS WAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

> know how to craete reusable methods/functions with parameters
    > reusable means it can be used around code
    > modifier returnValueType methodName(list of parameters) {}
        > modifier implies either 'public' or 'private'
        > returnValueType implies either 'void' or a data type like 'int'
            > 'void' means it doesn't return a value
        > parameters are the values the method will take in to use
            > you need to declare each parameter
                >e.g., public static void max(int num1, int num2, ...) {}


> don't "re-invent the wheel". there's probably a class method for 
what you're looking for.


> passing parameters means it's a copy (by value)

> Java uses a stack-based architecture when it comes to methods
    > important to keep in mind when making mupltiple functions in one file

> public vs private
> public static 'void' or 'any other data type'
    > void means it will not output or pass the end value
    > you can change this such that it takes in specific data type
       and it can output/pass a value of specific data type

> to refactor is to simplify or improve on the structuring of the code
    > this can be done by splitting parts of a code to separate methods


> overloading a method means to rewrite the same method, but have the parameters
be different
    > java then uses either methods depending on the method signature
        >i.e., what seems more appropriate to use
